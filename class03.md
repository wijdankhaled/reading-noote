## **LIST**

 *There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists. HTML provides us with three different types:*
   -  Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered.
    
      
   - nordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point.
   -  Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
   


*ordered list and he unordered list sturtcure*
 he ordered list is created with the < ol> element.Each item in the list is placed between an opening < li> tag and a closing </ li> tag. (The li stands for list item.)

 *The definition list*
 the definition list is created with the < dl> element and usually
 consists of a series of terms and their definitions.
Inside the < dl> element you will usually see pairs of < dt> and
< dd> elements

**Note**You can put a second list inside an < li> element to create a sub list or nested list.Browsers display nested lists indented further than the parent list. In **nested unordered lists** 
 
## Box Dimensions 
By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties 

 **Note** When you specify the width of a box, any padding or margin 
should be added to the width of it. Internet Explorer 6, however, 
has a quirk whereby it includes the padding and margins in the 
width of the box. 
## overflow
he overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content
contained within a box is larger than the box itself.
 - hidden:
This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in 
the box 
- scroll
This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll 
to see the missing content

 *Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:*
  Border, Margin and Padding
  The padding and margin
  properties are very helpful in adding space between various 
  items on the page.

## display 
- inline
This causes a block-level element to act like an inline 
element
- block
This causes an inline element to act like a block-level element.
- none
This hides an element from the page.

## border-image
the border-image property applies an image to the border of 
any box

## box-shadow
- Horizontal offset
Negative values position the shadow to the left of the box.
- Vertical offset
Negative values position the shadow to the top of the box.
- Blur distance
If omitted, the shadow is a solid line like a border.
-Spread of shadow
If used, a positive value will cause the shadow to expand in 
all directions, and a negative value will make it contract.

## border-radius
CSS3 introduces the ability to create rounded corners on any 
box, using a property called border-radius.

## border-radius
o create more complex shapes, you can specify different 
distances for the horizontal and the vertical parts of the rounded 
corners

## ARRAYS

*An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.*

![arrays](https://catalin.red/dist/uploads/2019/01/js-array-from-array-like.png)

**how we can make an array**
You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable (using the var 
keyword followed by the name of the array).

**VALU ES IN ARRAYS**
Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the 
numbering of this list starts at zero (not one). 

**index**
Each item in an array is automatically given a number called an index. This can be used 
to access specific items in the array.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  IF ... ELSE STATEMENTS
if ... e 1 se statement allows you to provide two sets of code: 
1. one set if the condition evaluates to true 
2. another set if the condition is false 

## SWITCH STATEMENTS 
A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible 
value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value

SWITCH 

• You have a default option that is run if 
none of the cases match.

• If a match is found, that code is run; then 
the break statement stops the rest of 
the switch statement running (providing 
better performance than multiple i f 
statements). 

**SHORT CIRCUIT VALUES**

Logical operators are processed left to right. 
They short-circuit (stop) as soon as they have a 
result - but they return the value that stopped 
the processing (not necessarily true or fa 1 se).

## LOOPS 

1. **FOR LOOPS**
A for loop is often used to loop 
through the items in an array. 

2. **WHILE LOOPS**

3. **DO WHILE LOOPS**

- switch statements allow you to compare a value 
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default 
option if none match). 

- Data types can be coerced from one type to another. 

- There are three types of loop: for, while, and 
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
