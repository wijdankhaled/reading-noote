# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

![api gateway](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*7jjx-99UkdErKuEW)

Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications. API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.

## What are serverless functions?

 (Links to an external site.)is a programmatic function written by a software developer for a single purpose. It's then hosted and maintained on infrastructure by cloud computing companies. These companies take care of code maintenance and execution so that developers can deploy new code faster and easier.

## If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?

To create the Lambda function

* Open the AWS Lambda console at [Lambda](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/.)

* Choose Create function.

* Choose Author from scratch. Under Basic information, do the following:

* For Function name, enter CustomerImport_ProcessInput.

* For Execution role, choose Use an existing role.

* For Existing role, choose ImporterPinpointRole.

* Choose Create function.

## Describe how a CDN works

To minimize the distance between the visitors and your website’s server, a CDN stores a cached version of its content in multiple geographical locations (a.k.a., points of presence, or PoPs). Each PoP contains a number of caching servers responsible for content delivery to visitors within its proximity.

In essence, CDN puts your content in many places at once, providing superior coverage to your users. For example, when someone in London accesses your US-hosted website, it is done through a local UK PoP. This is much quicker than having the visitor’s requests, and your responses, travel the full width of the Atlantic and back.

* Cloud Storage

Cloud storage is a cloud computing model that stores data on the Internet through a cloud computing provider who manages and operates data storage as a service. It’s delivered on demand with just-in-time capacity and costs, and eliminates buying and managing your own data storage infrastructure.

* CDN

A content delivery network (CDN) is a group of geographically distributed servers that speed up the delivery of web content by bringing it closer to where users are. Data centers across the globe use caching, a process that temporarily stores copies of files, so that you can access internet content from a web-enabled device or browser more quickly through a server near you
