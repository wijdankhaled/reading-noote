## How do bearer tokens work?

Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resource.

## Describe express middleware

Middleware is software containing functions that execute during the request-response cycle and have access to both the request object (req) and the response object (res). Middleware is executed during the window between when a server receives a request and when it sends a response.

Express middleware includes application-level, router-level, and error handling functionality and can be built-in or from a third party. Since Express.js has limited functionality of its own, an Express app is largely comprised of multiple middleware function calls.
