## What Is Node.js?
 is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
 Node Is Built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine.
 
 **The V8 engine**

  is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. 
 *This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.*

 ### How Do I Install Node.js?

  would suggest that you use a version manager instead. This is a program that allows you to install multiple versions of Node and switch between them at will.

  ## Node.js Has Excellent Support for Modern JavaScript

  As can be seen on this compatibility table, Node has excellent support for ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and beyond. As you’re only targeting one runtime (a specific version of the V8 engine), this means that you can write your JavaScript using the latest and most modern syntax. 

## What Is Node.js Used For?
we can turn our attention to the first of their common uses: installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.
These build tools come in all shapes and sizes, and you won’t get far in a modern JavaScript landscape without bumping into them. They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.

 ## What Are the Advantages of Node.js?
 - Aside from speed and scalability, an often-touted advantage of using JavaScript on a web server — as well as in the browser — is that your brain no longer needs to switch modes.
 - You can do everything in the same language, which, as a developer, makes you more productive (and hopefully, happier). For example, you can easily share code between the server and the client.
 - JavaScript is ubiquitous: most of us are familiar with JavaScript, or have used it at some point. This means that transitioning to Node development is potentially easier than to other server-side languages.
  ## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
   ## How does pair programming work?
   While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. 
   ## Why pair program?

   **there are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language:**

   - Listening 
   - hearing 
   - interpreting the vocabulary
   - Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea
   - Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey 
   - Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful

   **Pair programming touches on all four skills:**
   - developers explain out loud what the code should do
   - listen to others’ guidance
   - read code that others have written
   - write code themselves.
