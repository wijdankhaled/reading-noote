# Images

*You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.*

**Centering images Using css**


By default, images are inline 
elements. This means that they 
flow within the surrounding text. 
In order to center an image, it 
should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display
property with a value of block

**Background Images**

The background-image
property allows you to place 
an image behind any HTML 
element. This could be the entire 
page or just part of the page. By 
default, a background image will 
repeat to fill the entire box.

**Repeating imges**
  *repeat*
The background image is 
repeated both horizontally and 
vertically (the default way it 
is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isn't used).

### background-position
When an image is not being 
repeated, you can use the 
background-position
property to specify where in the 
browser window the background 
image should be placed. 

Using CSS, it is possible to create 
a link or button that changes to a 
second style when a user moves 
their mouse over it**known as a rollover** and a third style when 
they click on it.

### Contrast of background images
If you want to overlay text on a background image, the image must be low 
contrast in order for the text to be legible.

- High Contrast
A high contrast 
background 
image makes 
the text difficult 
to read.

- Low Contrast
A low contrast 
background 
image makes 
the text easier 
to read

- Screen
A screen 
added to a high 
contrast image 
makes the text 
easier to read.

### Domain Names& Hosting

- Domain Names
Your domain name is your web 
address (e.g. google.com or bbc.
co.uk). There are many websites 
that allow you to register domain 
names. Usually you will have to 
pay an annual fee to keep that 
domain name

- Hosting

So that other people can see 
your site, you will need to upload 
it to a web server. Web servers 
are special computers that are 
constantly connected to the 
Internet. They are specially set 
up to serve web pages when 
they are requested.

### FTP & Third Party Tools
To transfer your code and images from your 
computer to your hosting company, you use 
something known as File Transfer Protocol.

-  Search engine optimization helps visitors find your 
sites when using search engines.

-  Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to 
see how many people visit your site, how they find it, 
and what they do when they get there.

-  FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your 
local computer to your web server.

-  Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email 
newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website 
tools (to save you writing them from scratch).
