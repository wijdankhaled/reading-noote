# Graphs

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges

**Vertex**- A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.

**Edge** - An edge is a connection between two nodes.

**Neighbor** - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.

**Degree** - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

## Directed vs Undirected

An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

For example, in the graph below, Node C is connected to Node A, Node E and Node B. There are no “directions” given to point to specific vertices. The connection is bi-directional.

**Directed Graphs (Digraph)**
A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

Unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.

Compare the visual below with the undirected graph above. Can you see the difference? The Digraph has arrows pointing to specific nodes.

## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

**Connected**
A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.
In the visual above, this looks a lot more than what you are used to seeing. If you look closely at the different vertices of the graph, you will see that each node is connected to at least one other node or vertices. A Tree is a form of a connected graph. We will talk more about that in a bit.

**Disconnected**
A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.
In the above visual, the disconnected graph shows that some nodes may not always be connected to other nodes or vertices of the graph. It is complelty possible to have standalone nodes or edges (also known as islands) in a graph data structure.

## Acyclic vs Cyclic

**Acyclic Graph**
An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.

A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.

**Adjacency Matrix**
An Adjacency matrix is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix

Each Row and column represents each vertex of the data structure. The elements of both the column and the row must add up to 1 if there is an edge that connects the two, or zero if there isn’t a connection.
