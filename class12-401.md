# Socket.io

![](https://socket.io/images/rooms-redis.png)


Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server. It consists of:

a Node.js server: Source | API
a Javascript client library for the browser (which can be also run from Node.js): Source | API
Diagram for bidirectional communication

```

const socket = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:3000");

socket.onopen = () => {
  socket.send("Hello!");
};

socket.onmessage = (data) => {
  console.log(data);
};

```

## Review, Research, and Discussion

**What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?**

meet the demands of pervasive data-centric applications and services.
most cost-effective, efficient, and scalable networks for content delivery.
redundancies for full visibility

**UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?** 

-UDP is a connectionless protocol. No connection needs to be established between the source and destination before you transmit data. UDP does not have a mechanism to make sure that the payload is not corrupted. As a result, the application must take care of data integrity all by itself.

**Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?**

A server socket listens on a single port has Multiple connections on the same server can share the same server-side IP/Port pair as long as they are associated with different client-side IP/Port pairs, and the server would be able to handle as many clients as available system resources allow it to

**Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?**

server socket listens on a single port. All established client connections on that server are associated with that same listening port on the server side of the connection. An established connection is uniquely identified by the combination of client-side and server-side IP/Port pairs. Multiple connections on the same server can share the same server-side IP/Port pair as long as they are associated with different client-side IP/Port pairs, and the server would be able to handle as many clients as available system resources allow it to.
Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?
You can’t have two client sockets connect to each other in TCP, as the low-level connection protocol doesn’t work that way.

**Document the following Vocabulary Terms**

**Observer Pattern:** 

is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

**Listener:** 

is a function that is invoked when a particular event occurs, typically with an event object containing information about the event.

**Event Handler:**

 is a callback routine that operates asynchronously and handles inputs received into a program (events)

**Event Driven Programming:** 

is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision.

**Event Loop:** 

is a programming construct or design pattern that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program.

**Event Queue:** 

is a repository where events from an application are held prior to being processed by a receiving program or system.

**Call Stack:**

 The call stack is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) stack. The event loop continuously checks the call stack to see if there’s any function that needs to run. While doing so, it adds any function call it finds to the call stack and executes each one in order.

**Emit/Raise/Trigger:**

 The emit() function raises the specified event. First parameter is name of the event as a string and then arguments. An event can be emitted with zero or more arguments.

**database:**

 is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.
