# Read: 04a - Dynamic web pages with JavaScript
**in the web bages you can  fit together with the
HTML and CSS in your web pages**

- HTML ONLY
Starting with the HTML layer
allows you to focus on the most
important thing about your site:
its content.
Being plain HTML, this layer
should work on all kinds of
devices, be accessible to all
users, and load quite quickly on
slow connections

- HTML+CSS
Adding the CSS rules in a
separate file keeps rules
regarding how the page looks
away from the content itself.
You can use the same style sheet
with all of your site, making your
sites faster to load and easier
to maintain. Or you can use
different style sheets with the
same content to create different
views of the same data. 

- HTML+CSS+JAVASCRIPT
The JavaScript is added last
and enhances the usability of
the page or the experience of
interacting with the site.
Keeping it separate means
that the page still works if the
user cannot load or run the
JavaScript. You can also reuse
the code on several pages
(making the site faster to load
and easier to maintain).

## CREATING A BASIC JAVASCRIPT
JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not
need any new tools to write a script. 

**A JavaScript file is just a text file (like HTML and CSS files are) but it has a . j s file extension, so save this file with the name add-content . j s**

### LINKING TO A JAVASCRIPT FILE FROM AN HTML PAGE

'You may see JavaScript in the HTML between
opening <script> and closing </script> tags
(but it is better to put scripts in their own files).'

### PLACING THE SCRIPT IN THE PAGE
'You may see JavaScript in the HTML between
opening <script> and closing </script> tags
(but it is better to put scripts in their own files).'

**JAVASCRIPT RUNS WHERE IT IS FOUND IN THE HTML**
When the browser comes across a <script> element, it stops to
load the script and then checks to see if it needs to do anything.

#### how i do i rite for web pages?

- It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own 'JavaScript'
file.

- 'The HTML' <script> element is used 'in HTML' pages
to tell the browser to load the 'JavaScript' file (rather like
the <link> element can be used to load a' CSS' file).

- 'If' you view the source code 'of' the page 'in' the browser,
the 'JavaScript' will not have changed the' HTML,'
because the script works 'with' the model 'of' the web
page that the browser has created.

### basic javascript instraction.

'A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one
'Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
'Statements should end with a semicolon'

**'JAVASCRIPT IS CASE SENSITIVE'
'JavaScript is case sensitive so hourNow means
'something different to HourNow or HOURNOW'**'

### WHAT IS A VARIABLE? 
A script will have to temporarily
store the bits of information it
needs to do its job. It can store this
data in variables.

1. Remember the value for width
2. Remember the value for height
3. Multiply width by height to get the area
4. Return the result to the user
