# Text
-  Headings and paragraphs
- Bold, italic, emphasis
-  Structural and semantic markup

**HTML has six "levels" of headings:**

from < h1.......to h6 >
- < p>
To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the 
paragraph with an opening "p" tag and closing "p" tag

- < b>
By enclosing words in the tags b and b we can make characters appear bold

- < i>
By enclosing words in the tags i and i we can make characters appear italic
- < sub>
The sub element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas such as H2o

**White Space**
In order to make code easier to read, web page authors often add extra spaces or start some elements on new lines

**Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules**
- < br \ >  
As you have already seen, the browser will automatically show 
each new paragraph or heading on a new line. 

- < hr />
To create a break between themes — such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play — you can add a horizontal rule between sections 

There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the 
structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the 
pages — they are known as **semantic markup**.

- < strong>
The use of the < strong>element indicates that its content has strong importance. For example, the words contained in this element might 
be said with strong emphasis.

- < em>
The < em> element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence

- < blockquote>
The < blockquote> element is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph. Note how the < p> element is still used inside the  < blockquote> element. 
-------------------------------------------------------
**HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).**

**They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).**
-------------------------------------------------------
 *A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.*

 **COMMENTS**
 1.*SINGLE-LINE COMMENTS*
In a single-line comment, anything that follows the two forward slash characters I/ on that line will not be processed by the JavaScript interpreter. 

2.*MULTI-LINE COMM ENTS*
To write a comment that stretches over more than one line, you use a multi-line comment, starting with the /* characters and ending with the */ characters. 

### A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in **variables.**

RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES
1.The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number

2.The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.

3.You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords 
are special words that tell the interpreter to do something

### ARRAYS
An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. 
var colors; 
colors ['white', 'black', ' custom']; 
var el document.getElementByld('col ors'); 
el . textContent = col ors[ O];

**Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).**
-----------------------------------------------------
 ### EXPRESSIONS
 An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.

 ### OPERATORS
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to 
create a single value from one or more values.

**Expressions evaluate into a single value.**

**Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.** 

## **Decition Macking**
 There are a lot of places in script where decition are made determinal which lines code made should be run next. flowchart can help you plan.
 *Flowchart* shap represent a point where decition must be made and code can make one of two different paths.

  - Evaluate conditions and condition statments
  There are two components to a decision:
   1. experssion is evalute which return value
   2. conditional statment 
   

- Compartion operaters 
1. equal to ==
2. not equal to !=
3.strict equal to ===
4.strict not equal to !==
5.gerater than >
6.less than <
7.greter than or equal >=
7.less than or equal <=

*Structuring comparsion operater :one operater and two operands.

**logical operater**

**if statment**
1. if statment

2. else if
