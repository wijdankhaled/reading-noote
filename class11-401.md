# Event Driven Applications

**Why is access control important?**

Access controls limit access to information and information processing systems. When implemented effectively, they mitigate the risk of information being accessed without the appropriate authorization, unlawfully and the risk of a data breach.

**Describe an application that would need access control**

Role Based Access Control grants access based on a user’s role and implements key security principles, such as “least privilege” and “separation of privilege.” Thus, someone attempting to access information can only access data that’s deemed necessary for their role.

**What is a role used for?**

The roles refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network, Employees are only allowed to access the information necessary to effectively perform their job duties. Access can be based on several factors, such as authority, responsibility, and job competency. In addition, access to computer resources can be limited to specific tasks such as the ability to view, create, or modify a file

**Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?**

The main advantage of role-based access control is that it’s been widely adopted and allows small- to medium-sized organizations to eliminate implementing access controls on an individual basis.
