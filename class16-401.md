Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. Millions of customers—including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies—are using AWS to lower costs, become more agile, and innovate faster.

## Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle

First a user gives a client a URL, the client builds a request for information or resources to be generated by a server. When the server receives that request, it uses the information included in the request to build a response that contains the requested information. Once built, that response is sent back to the client in the requested format, to be rendered to the user.

## Explain what a server is, as it relates to the WRRC

A server program awaits and fulfills requests from client programs, which might be running in the same, or other computers. A given application in a computer might function as a client with requests for services from other programs and as a server of requests from other programs

## What does it mean to deploy an application?

It is the process of installing, configuring, and enabling a specific application or set of applications, usually through an application manager app manager or software management system, to a specific URL on a server.

### Terms

* Server: a server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the client.

* Pub/Sub: Pub/Sub allows services to communicate asynchronously, with latencies on the order of 100 milliseconds, and enables you to create systems of event producers and consumers, called publishers and subscribers. Publishers communicate with subscribers asynchronously by broadcasting events, rather than by synchronous remote procedure calls (RPCs).

* WRRC: the request/response cycle is a useful guide to see how all the app’s files and folders fit together. The request/response cycle traces how a user’s request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app .
