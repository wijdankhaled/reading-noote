Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.

## What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”

Cookies are automatically saved, sent and removed by the browser. The frontend developer does not have to worry about implementing this part, nor is there any scope of a mistake from the frontend side. This is not true for localstorage
for API calls to the server, they will only get the session tokens if they are using cookies – localstorage will not work”
The objective here is that the user should use the same session when navigating to different subdomains of a site. This can be easily done via cookies by setting the cookie domain as “.yoursite.com”. This is not easily possible to do via localstorage since the store is not shared across domains / subdomains.

## Explain 3rd party cookies

A third-party cookie is placed on a website by someone other than the owner (a third party) and collects user data for the third party. As with standard cookies, third-party cookies are placed so that a site can remember something about the user at a later time. Third-party cookies, however, are often set by advertising networks that a site may subscribe to in the hopes of driving up sales or page hits

## How do pixel tags work?

It’s a 1×1-pixel graphic used for tracking user behavior, site conversions, web traffic, and other metrics at a site’s server level. In other words, it is a tiny pixel-sized image, usually hidden, embedded in everything, from banner ads to emails.

You add the tracking pixel using a code in your site’s HTML code or email, which contains an external link to the pixel server. When someone visits your website, the HTML code is processed by their browser, which follows the link and opens the hidden graphic. This action is identified and recorded in the server’s log files. This method allows for different information about the visitor to be transmitted

## Terms 

**cookies**
HTTP cookies are essential to the modern Internet but a vulnerability to your privacy. As a necessary part of web browsing, HTTP cookies help web developers give you more personal, convenient website visits. Cookies let websites remember you, your website logins, shopping carts and more. But they can also be a treasure trove of private info for criminals to spy on.

**authorization**
uthorization is a security mechanism to determine access levels or user/client privileges related to system resources including files, services, computer programs.

**access control**
The goal of access control is to minimize the risk of unauthorized access to physical and logical systems. Access control is a fundamental component of security compliance programs that ensures security technology and access control policies are in place to protect confidential information, such as customer data.

**conditional rendering**
Conditional Rendering In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application. Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript.
