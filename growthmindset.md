## How you can benefit from a growth mindset
## What is a growth mindset?
A growth mindset believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

### Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset

1. Challenges
2. Obstacles
3. Effort
4. Criticism
5. Success of others

### Growing at work, and outside work too
I’ve been guilty of having a fixed mindset far too often, and I’m working to change that. Things like wisdom and achievement are the products of putting in hard work, not avoiding it. We live in a society where the instant gratification monkey sits on everyone’s shoulder. But the pleasures that result from determination and hard work far outweigh anything that devilish chimp has to offer. The right mindset, like the growth mindset, helps put things in perspective.

# Basic writing and formatting syntax
Create sophisticated formatting for your prose and code on GitHub with simple syntax.

#### 1.heading

To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.

#The largest heading

##The second largest heading

######The smallest heading

#### 2.Styling text
You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, or strikethrough text

#### 3.Quoting text

You can quote text with a >.

In the words of Abraham Lincoln:

#### 4.Quoting code

You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted.

Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.

# Getting Started with GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and easily published through GitHub. The quickest way to get up and running is by using the Jekyll Theme Chooser to load a pre-made theme. You can then modify your GitHub Pages’ content and style remotely via the web or locally on your computer.
