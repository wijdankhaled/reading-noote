## 1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
are good fit for the complex query intensive environment

## 2. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage. But, NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.

## 3. Which type of database is best for scalability?
QL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.
## What does SQL stand for?
Structured Query Language What is a realational database? A relational database is a type of database. It uses a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database. Often, data in a relational database is organized into tables.

## What is a ‘schema’?

The term "schema" refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed (divided into database tables in the case of relational databases). The formal definition of a database schema is a set of formulas (sentences) called integrity constraints imposed on a database.

## What is a NoSQL database?
NoSQL Database is a non-relational Data Management System, that does not require a fixed schema.

## What is inside of a Mongo database?
records that consist of documents such as json.

## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
MongoDB. No strict schema.

## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
They don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID).
