# AWS: S3 and Lambda

![s3](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2020/05/19/s3-lambda4.png)

## S3

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. This means customers of all sizes and industries can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive

## What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.

## Describe “The Cloud”

The definition for the cloud can seem murky, but essentially, it’s a term used to describe a global network of servers, each with a unique function. The cloud is not a physical entity, but instead is a vast network of remote servers around the globe which are hooked together and meant to operate as a single ecosystem.

## What is a container as it relates to computers and servers?

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

## What is auto-scaling?

Auto Scaling lets you build scaling plans that automate how groups of different resources respond to changes in demand.

Auto Scaling allows your application to always have the compute capacity needed and reduces the need to manually monitor server capacity.

## What is bandwidth? (Links to an external site.)

The maximum amount of data transmitted over an internet connection in a given amount of time. Bandwidth is often mistaken for internet speed when it’s actually the volume of information that can be sent over a connection in a measured amount of time – calculated in megabits per second (Mbps).

## (Links to an external site.)How do cloud providers compute service costs?

cloud providers determine the expense to maintaining the network. They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor.

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

* Server Instances

the partition of a computer that you used on the cloud.
Containers

* A container

 is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

* Cloud Services

the services that you can do on computers online not locally. or Cloud services are infrastructure, platforms, or software that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to users through the internet.

* Cloud Architecture

Cloud architecture is the way technology components combine to build a cloud, in which resources are pooled through virtualization technology and shared across a network.

* AWS

Amazon web Services, it is a platform that provide a cloud computing services in general.

* EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku

both of them consider as a Paas, platform as a service.
we use them to deploy our backend-server in general. but in EB we can deploy even fron-end but in Heroku we can’t.
autoscalling in EB, but manual scalling in Heroku.
