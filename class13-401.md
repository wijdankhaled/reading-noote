# Message Queues

**Review, Research, and Discussion**

![](https://www.cloudamqp.com/img/blog/thumb-mq.jpg)

A message queue is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures. Messages are stored on the queue until they are processed and deleted. Each message is processed only once, by a single consumer. Message queues can be used to decouple heavyweight processing, to buffer or batch work, and to smooth spiky workloads.

**What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?**

Whereas HTTP relies on a client request to receive a response from the server for every exchange, WebSockets allow for full-duplex bidirectional communication. This enables the server to send real-time updates asynchronously, without requiring the client to submit a request each time

**Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?**

Even when websockets can be used, the initial connection setup it done over HTTP. Also, a socket.io server will attach to an HTTP server so it can serve its own client code through /socket.io/socket.io.js .

**What happens when a client emits an event?**

The event gets passed to the server through websockets.

**What happens when a server emits an event?**

each time a peer connects to it.

**What happens if a client “misses” an event?**

The client will be disconnected.

**How can we mitigate this?**

We should consider a reconnect.

## Terms

**Socket:** 

it was created to use open connections to facilitate realtime communication, still a relatively new phenomenon at the time.

**Web Socket:**

 it is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user’s browser and a server.

**Socket.io:**

 it is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server.

**Client**:

 a computer hardware device or software that accesses a service made available by a server.

**Server:**

 is a physical computer dedicated to run services to serve the needs of other computers. Depending on the service that is running, it could be a file server, database server, home media server, print server, or web server.

**OSI Model:**

 The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network.

**TCP Model:**

 TCP model defines how devices should transmit data between them and enables communication over networks and large distances. The model represents how data is exchanged and organized over networks.

**TCP:** 

TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network.

**UDP:**

 User Datagram Protocol, or UDP, is a communication protocol used across the Internet for especially time-sensitive transmissions such as video playback or DNS lookups.

Packets: it is a small segment of a larger message.
