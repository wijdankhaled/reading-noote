Role-based access control (RBAC) is a policy-neutral access-control mechanism defined around roles and privileges. The components of RBAC such as role-permissions, user-role and role-role relationships make it simple to perform user assignments. A study by NIST has demonstrated that RBAC addresses many needs of commercial and government organizations.[4] RBAC can be used to facilitate administration of security in large organizations with hundreds of users and thousands of permissions

## Why is the Context API useful?

Context API is easy to is use as it has a short learning curve. It requires less code, and because there's no need of extra libraries, bundle sizes are reduced.

## Can a component outside of a provider get its context?

No, react context is available only when the UI is available. This means that on background tasks you can't access it. But that doesn't mean that you can't access it "outside" of components.

## What are some common use cases for using the Context API?

Theming — Pass down app themei18n — Pass down translation messagesAuthentication — Pass down current authenticated user.
