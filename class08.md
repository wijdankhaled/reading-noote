## Layout
- Building Blocks
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
   1. Block-level elements start on a new line
   2. Inline elements flow in between surrounding text.


CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control 
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute 
positioning. 
- Normal flow
- Relative Positioning
- bsolute positioning


To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use 
box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed. (You will meet these 
when we introduce the positioning schemes.

- **Screen size***:

Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.
*Screen Resolution* Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch.
*Page Sizes*:Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide .
*Liquid layout* designs stretch and contract as the user increases 
or decreases the size of their browser window.

- **creen Resolution**

Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch.

- **Page Sizes**

designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide 
(since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).

#### Fixed Width **Layouts**

- Advantages
1. Pixel values are accurate 
at controlling size and 
positioning of elements.

2.  The designer has far greater 
control over the appearance 
and position of items on the 
page than with liquid layouts.

3.  You can control the lengths 
of lines of text regardless of 
the size of the user's window.

- Disadvantages
1.  You can end up with big gaps 
around the edge of a page.

2. f the user's screen is a much 
higher resolution than the 
designer's screen, the page 
can look smaller and text can 
be harder to read.

3.  The design works best on 
devices that have a site or 
resolution similar to that of 
desktop or laptop computers.

**Liquid Layouts**
Liquid layout designs 
stretch and contract 
as the user increases 
or decreases the 
size of their browser 
window. They tend to 
use percentages

### CSS Frameworks
CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for 
common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating 
printer-friendly versions of pages and so on.

- **<div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.**

- **Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.**

- **Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).**
