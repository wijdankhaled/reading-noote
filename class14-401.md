# Event Driven Architecture

## Review, Research, and Discussion

**1. What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?**

FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing and ensure that the order in which messages are sent and received is strictly preserved.

**2. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?**

By having the client emit a “received” event back to the server upon receipt of the message

**What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?**

The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods

**How do you test an event driven system?**

There are multiple levels of tests you will typically write for your system. In the most canonical case, you will write unit tests, service tests, and end-to-end tests. In each of these cases, your System Under Test (SUT, what is actually being tested) comprises a different part of your application.

**Terms:**


FIFO Queue	FIFO is an abbreviation for first in, first out. It is a method for handling data structures where the first element is processed first and the newest element is processed last
Pub/Sub	Pub/Sub allows services to communicate asynchronously, with latencies on the order of 100 milliseconds.

## AWS SNS and SQS

**Q: What is Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)?**

Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and send notifications from the cloud. It provides developers with a highly scalable, flexible, and cost-effective capability to publish messages from an application and immediately deliver them to subscribers or other applications.

**Q: How can I get started using Amazon SNS?**

You can create an Amazon SNS topic and publish messages in a few steps by completing our 10-minute tutorial, Send Fanout Notifications.
For additional detail, see the Amazon SNS Developer Guide, and sample code in the Resource Center.

**SQS**

Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. SQS eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating message-oriented middleware, and empowers developers to focus on differentiating work.
