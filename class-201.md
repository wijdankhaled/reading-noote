## **HTML & CSS**
- Browsers:People access websites using software called a web browser.
- Web Servers:When you ask your browser fora web page, the request is sent across the Internet to a special computer known as a web server which hosts the website.
- Screen readers : are programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user.

**How the Web Works**
When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

**Structure**
*HTML Describes the Structure of Pages :* 
To describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want
to appear on the page.

**Tags**
-A Closer Look at Tags : <></>
  Attributes provide additional information
about the contents of an element. They appear
on the opening tag of the element and are
made up of two parts: a name and a value,
separated by an equals sign.
ex:
<p lang="en-us">Paragraph in English</p>

- <body>: Everything inside this element is
shown inside the main browser
window.
- <head> : element.
This contains information
about the page.
- <title>:
element are either shown in the
top of the browser.
- Comments in HTML : <!-- --> 
- ID Attribute :< tag id="id for tag">< tag />
- class attribute: way to identify several elements
as being different from the
other elements on the page. 
- Block elements are
< h1>, < p>, < ul>, and < li>
- inline elements are
<a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>
- Grouping Text &
Elements In a Block :The < div> element allows you to
group a set of elements together
in one block-level box.
- Grouping Text and Elements Inline :The <span> element acts like an inline equivalent of the <div> .
- An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page — and in that window you can see another page .




**Extra Markup**
Since the web was first created, there have
been several different versions of HTML:
- Html 4:
With the exception of a few
elements added in HTML5.
- XHTML 1.0 :
In 1998, a language called XML
was published. Its purpose
was to allow people to write
new markup languages.

**HTML5 Layout**
**HTML5** introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page.
The <header> and <footer> elements can be used for:
- The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.
- A header or footer for an
individual <article> or
<section> within the page
- The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated .
- The purpose of the <hgroup>
element is to group together a
set of one or more <h1> through
<h6> elements so that they are
treated as one single heading .

**Who is the Site For?**
Every website should be designed for the target audience—not just for yourself or the site owner.
**Why People Visit YOUR Website?**
 - Key Motivations
 - Specific Goals
**How Often People Will Visit Your Site?**
Some sites benefit from being updated more
frequently than others. Some information.

**Wireframe**A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require.
**site map** The aim is to create a diagram
of the pages that will be used
to structure the site. 
**Designing Navigation** Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also
helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized.
**grouping and Similarity**When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements
into groups.
**Visual hierarchy**Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find
information.

## DEFINING A GOAL & DESIGNING THE SCRIPT 


![flowchart](https://learnersbucket.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/do-while-flow-chart.png)

**A script is a series of instructions that the computer 
can follow in order to achieve a goal. **

**Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of 
all the instructions. **

**Computers approach tasks in a different way than 
humans, so your instructions must let the computer 
solve the task prggrammatically. **

**To approach writing a script, break down your goal into 
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed 
to complete that task (a flowchart can help). **

## OBJECTS & PROPERTIES

Each object can have its own: 
- Properties 
- Events 
- Methods

### EVENTS
*In the real world, people interact with objects. These interactions can 
change the values of the properties in these objects.*

### METHODS 
*Methods represent things people need to do with objects. They can 
retrieve or update the values of an object's properties.*
