# how do computers work ?

**information is represented inside the
computer using tiny electrical signals
going on and off at mind-boggling speeds**

#### use circuits to do everything from simple math to simulating entire virtual worlds

## But what makes a computer a computer?
## What does make a computer a computer anyway?

if a machine could be designed and built to help us with the thinking work we do,
like solving equations or tracking the stars in the sky.
Rather than moving or manipulating physical things like dirt and stone,
these machines would need to be designed to manipulate information.

**It would need to take**
 1.input,
2.store information
3.process it and then
 4.output the results.

 Computers started out as basic calculators,
which was already really awesome at the time, and they were only manipulating numbers back then.
But now we can use them to talk to each other, we can use them to play games, control robots,
and do any crazy thing that you could probably imagine.


*Modern computers look nothing like those clunky old machines
but they still do these same four things.*

![the process](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/52/08/e6/5208e624733e21d17bff4fd7674d6db3.jpg)

- input
is the stuff that the world does or that you do that makes the computer do stuff.
You can tell computers what to do with the keyboard,
you can tell them what to do with the mouse, the microphone, the camera.

- process
A computer's processor takes information from memory.
It manipulates it or changes it using an algorithm,
which is just a series of commands.

- output 
And then it sends the processed information back to be stored in memory again.
This continues until the processed information is ready to be output.

 
 *A computer display can show text, photos, videos, or interactive games -- even virtual reality!
The output of a computer may even include signals to control a robot.*


#### The computers we use today look really different from the earliest thinking machines.
**And who knows what the computers of tomorrow will be like?**

**computer always doing those same four things.**

1.take in information,
2.store it as data,
3.process it,
4. output the result

This on/off state of a single wire is called a bit,
and it's the smallest piece of information a computer can store.

If you use more wires you get more bits: more ones and zeros.

They are the backbone of how all computers input, store, process, and output informatio

**computers work on ones and zeros.**

the circuit for an 8-bit adder has lots of little adders inside of it, which together, calculate the sum

**why are smaller computers also faster?**
Well, because the smaller the circuit is, the less distance the electrical signal has to go.
