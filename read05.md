- is equal to : ==
this operators compares two valus to see if they are the same 
- is not equal to :!=
this operators compares two valus to see if they are **not** the same

-Type of varible :
1. numbers 
2. string 
3. booleans

- Greaten than :>
this operate cheacks if number on left is greate than number on right.
- less than :<
this operate cheacks if number on right is greate than number on left.
-- Greaten than or equal to :>=
this operate cheacks if number on left is greate than or equal number on right.
- less than or equal to :<=
this operate cheacks if number on right is greate than number on left.



 ### local operate :is usually retrun single value (ture or false).
