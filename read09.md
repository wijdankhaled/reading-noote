## What is a text editor? 
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser,The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

**features should you look for in a text editor**
- code completion :A great feature of any text editing software is code completion. Code
completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion
feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally
typed.
- syntax highlighting;
- a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue)
- the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them .
- able to write your HTML and CSS more
efficiently .


**Using The Software That Already Comes With Your Computer**
- On Mac
computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called,
“Text Edit.”
- On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with
your computer is called, “Notepad.”
- on Linux computers, each distribution will have its own text
editor already installed but which one might depend on the flavor of
your particular distribution.

*These text editors can all be downloaded
and installed to your computer from their respective websites.*

**The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs**
*A text editor* kind of gives away what it does in the title—it edits text,It also manages text, and manages files

*An IDE* (Integrated Development Environment) is really a 
suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is 
a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.


## The Command Line!
** Linux has a graphical user interface and it works pretty much like the GUI's on other systems that you are familiar with such as Windows and OSX **

 ### So what are they exactly?
 A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text

  *When you enter commands, they are actually stored in a history. You can traverse this history using the up and down arrow keys. So don't bother re-typing out commands you have previously entered, you can usually just hit the up arrow a few times. You can also edit these commands using the left and right arrow keys to move the cursor where you want*

  #### Basic Navigation!
   - pwd which stands for Print Working Directory.
   -  ls. It's short for list. Let's give it a go.


   #### Here are some more building blocks you may use to help build your paths.
   - ~ (tilde) - This is a shortcut for your home directory

  - . (dot) - This is a reference to your current directory.
  - .. (dotdot)- This is a reference to the parent directory
  - cd which stands for change directory


**Relative path**
A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.

**Absolute path**
A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.

**file**
obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
**ls -a**
List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.

**Everything is a file under Linux**
Even directories.
**Linux is an extensionless system**
Files can have any extension they like or none at all.
**Linux is case sensitive**
Beware of silly typos.
