# the three most commonly used image formats
1. **JPEG**
2. **PNG**
3. **GIF**

## the use
- Use **JPEG** format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth

- Use **PNG** format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos

- Use **GIF** format for images that contain animations.
### Compression

Almost all forms of data that we see on the internet — text, image, video etc. — are compressed to reduce the size of data and ensure faster transmission

**Compression can be of two types**
- lossless
it is possible to reconstruct the original image from the compressed image because there is no information loss during compression.
- lossy
it is **not** possible to reconstruct the original image from the compressed image because there is no information loss during compression.

*JPEG is a lossy compression specification that takes advantage of human perception*

**PNG** is a lossless image format using [DEFLATE compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflate)

*No data is lost during compression and no compression artefacts are introduced in the image.*

#### Colours
There is a significant difference in the number of colours that can be supported by these 3 formats.

 1. **JPEG** images can support around 16 million colours. This is what makes them suitable for storing images of natural scenes 

 2. **JPEG** images can support around 16 million colours. This is what makes them suitable for storing images of natural scenes.

 3. **PNG** images mainly have two modes — PNG8 and PNG24. PNG8 can support upto 256 colours whereas PNG24 can handle upto 16 million colours like a JPEG image

 ### Animation

 Animation, in this case, refers to any change or movement in the image. It doesn’t necessarily have to have frame rates like an animated video, but essentially a part or the entire image changes with time.

 ## Images i html
Images can be used to set the tone for a site in less time than it takes to read a description

**Adding Images**

**< img>** 
To add an image into the page you need to use an < img> element. 

- src 
This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL 
pointing to an image on your own site

- alt
This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.

- title
You can also use the titleattribute with the < img> element 
to provide additional information about the imag

**two other attributes that specify its size:**
1. **height**
This specifies the height of the image in pixels
2. **width**
This specifies the width of the image in pixels

 ### Where to Place Images in Your Code
 1. before a paragraph The paragraph starts on a new line after the image.

 2. inside the start of a paragraphThe first row of text aligns with the bottom of the image.

3. in the middle of a paragraphThe image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in


**align**
The align attribute was commonly used to indicate how the other parts of a page should 
flow around an image

1. left
This aligns the image to the left (allowing text to flow around its right-hand side).
1. right
This aligns the image to the right(allowing text to flow around its left-hand side).

*You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image*

**Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.**

## color

**rgb values**
These express colors in terms 
of how much red, green and 
blue are used to make it up. For 
example: rgb(100,100,90)

**hex codes**
These are six-digit codes that 
represent the amount of red, 
green and blue in a color, 
preceded by a pound or hash # 
sign. For example: #ee3e80

**color names**
There are 147 predefined color 
names that are recognized 
by browsers. For example: 
DarkCyan

- CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive 
way to specify colors using:

1. hue Hue is the colloquial idea of color 
2. saturation
Saturation is the amount of 
gray in a color
3. lightness
Lightness is the amount of 
white (lightness) or black 
(darkness) in a color

**CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.**
**CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.**

## Text
- **Typeface Terminology**
1. Serif 
Serif fonts have extra details on 
the ends of the main strokes of 
the letters. These details are 
known as serifs.

2. Sans-Serif
Sans-serif fonts have straight 
ends to letters, and therefore 
have a much cleaner design

3. Monospace
Every letter in a monospace (or 
fixed-width) font is the same 
width. (Non-monospace fonts 
have different widths.)

**font-family**
The font-family property 
allows you to specify the 
typeface that should be used for 
any text inside the element(s) to 
which a CSS rule applies

- There are properties to control the choice of font, size, 
weight, style, and spacing.

-  There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume 
most people will have installed.

-  If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are 
several options, but you need to have the right license 
to use them.

-  You can control the space between lines of text, 
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned 
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be 
indented.

- You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an 
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or 
when they have visited a link
